"I have friends, too, who frequently ask me to dine,",,,,,
When I taste of choice viands and sip the best wine;,,,,,
"But full oft I decline these kind invitations,",,,,,
Of home being fond and my own meditations.,,,,,
"On my sofa I lounge with illustrious dead,",,,,,
And rejoice there are so many books to be read. -,,,,,
"I've sharp-pointed needles, a well-polish'd thimble",,,,,
To enweave slender threads with fingers right nimble:,,,,,
"I've long letters to read, and still longer to write,",,,,,
"In my mansion must see all things burnish'd and bright,",,,,,
"Wherein summers and winters, eighteen I have spent,",,,,,
"With springs also, and autumns, in peace and content,",,,,,
Oblivious never to the strict day of rent.,,,,,
